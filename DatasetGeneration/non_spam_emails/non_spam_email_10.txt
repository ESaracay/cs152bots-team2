Subject: Apologies for the previous message

Hi Bob,

I just wanted to apologize for the previous message sent from this device. It was actually my friend Kate who wrote it, and I didn't realize she had accessed my phone to send it to you.

Apologies for any confusion this may have caused.

Take care,
Alice
