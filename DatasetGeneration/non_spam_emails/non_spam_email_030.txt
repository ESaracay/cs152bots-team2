Subject: Late Night Update and Check-in

Dear Bob,

Just wanted to let you know that he got in at 2 and was very apologetic. It turns out, N had fallen out and she was acting like a spoilt child, which he got caught up in. We won't dwell on the fact that it lasted till 2! As for me, I'm not doing too badly. How about you?

Best regards,
Alice
