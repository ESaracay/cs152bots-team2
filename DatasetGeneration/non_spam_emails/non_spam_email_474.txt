Subject: Account Transactions Inquiry

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to check with you if you've been transferring any money into my account recently. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked my balance, and I thought it might have been from you. You see, I don't receive statements for that account.

Thank you,

Alice
