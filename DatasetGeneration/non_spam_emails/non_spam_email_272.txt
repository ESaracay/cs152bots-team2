Subject: Staying in Harlem during Audition Season

Dear Bob,

I have great news! From February to April, I'll be getting a place to stay in Harlem. This means I won't have to hustle back and forth during audition season like I've had to do ever since my sister moved away from the area. I'm really looking forward to this change and it should make things a lot easier for me.

Best regards,
Alice
