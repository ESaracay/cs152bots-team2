Subject: My Apologies About Your Accommodations

Hi Bob,

I just found out how embarrassed you were by the accommodations I provided. I honestly thought you liked it, as I was doing the best I could and you always seemed so happy about "the cave." I apologize for not being able to offer more and for putting you in a situation that was uncomfortable for you.

Please forgive me, and let's work together to find a solution that makes us both happy.

Best regards,
Alice
