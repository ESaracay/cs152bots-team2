Subject: The Value of Friendship

Hi Bob,

I just wanted to share a thought about the importance of friendship. Friendship is not a game to play, and it's not just a word to say. It doesn't start on March and ends on May. Friendship is all about being there for each other, through thick and thin. It is tomorrow, yesterday, today, and every day.

Keep nurturing our friendship and cherish every moment!

Best regards,
Alice
