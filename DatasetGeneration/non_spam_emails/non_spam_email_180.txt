Subject: Different Feelings and Wavering Decisions

Dear Bob,

I hope this finds you well. I wanted to share with you that I am going through a very different feeling lately. My decisions seem to be wavering, and coping with these emotions has been quite the challenge. However, I have faith that time will eventually heal everything, and I will find steadiness in my path.

Warm regards,
Alice
