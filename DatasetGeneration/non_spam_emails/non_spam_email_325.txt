Subject: Discussing Financial Situation with Uncle John

Dear Bob,

I was wondering if it would be okay for you to call Uncle John and let him know that things are not the same in Nigeria as they are here. I need him to understand that the $NUMBER dollars he sent will last for 2 years, and that I know it's a strain, but I plan to pay back every dime he gives. It's important for him to know that expecting anything more from you is not practical. 

Best regards,
Alice
