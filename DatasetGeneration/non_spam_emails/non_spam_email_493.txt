Subject: Beautiful Truth Against Gravity

Message:

Dear Bob,

I stumbled upon a beautiful truth against gravity today and wanted to share it with you. Read carefully: "Our heart feels light when someone is in it.. But it feels very heavy when someone leaves it."

Have a wonderful good morning!

Best regards,
Alice
