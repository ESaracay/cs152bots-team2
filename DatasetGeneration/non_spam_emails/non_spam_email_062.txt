Subject: Welp - A Semi-Obscure Internet Slang

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to share something interesting with you. "Welp" is somewhat of a semi-obscure internet slang, often used in informal conversations online. It's a fun and quirky term that's definitely worth knowing about.

Looking forward to chatting more about internet lingo!

Best,
Alice
