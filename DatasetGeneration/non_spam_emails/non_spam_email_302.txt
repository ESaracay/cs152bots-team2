Subject: Urgent: Need Blake's Address

Message:
Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I need a quick favor - can you please provide me with Blake's address? Carlos wanted me to meet him there but I got a bit lost and he's not answering his phone. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Alice
