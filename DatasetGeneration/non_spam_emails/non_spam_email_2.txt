Subject: A plea from my heart

Dear Bob,

I wanted to take a moment to express something very important to me. You are incredibly close to my heart, and the thought of you leaving fills me with a deep sadness. If you were to go away, I would be completely shattered.

Please, I ask you to stay with me. Your presence in my life means more than words can express.

Sincerely,
Alice
