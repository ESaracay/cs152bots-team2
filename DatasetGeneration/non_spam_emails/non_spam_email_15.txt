Subject: A Thought on Maturity

Dear Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to share a thought with you regarding maturity.

The sign of maturity is not when we start saying big things, but actually it is when we start understanding small things. Let's appreciate the little things in life and grow together.

Wishing you a lovely evening.

Best regards,
Alice
