Subject: Math Calculation Instructions

Message: Hi Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. To perform the calculations, follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numbers independently.
2. Count the decimal points.
3. For the division, push the decimal places as I showed you earlier.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best,
Alice
