Subject: Love and Care Despite the Distance

Dear Bob,

The sun may not be able to reach the Earth, but it sends its love as rays of light. Similarly, clouds may not be able to touch rivers, but they deliver their affection through rain. Although I cannot physically be with you at the moment, I want you to know that my love and care is still being sent to you in the form of this message. Wishing you a delightful evening!

Warmly,
Alice
