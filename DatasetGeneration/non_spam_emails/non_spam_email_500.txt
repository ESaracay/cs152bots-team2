Subject: Good News and Best Day Coming

Dear Bob,

A large percentage of people marry their lovers because they have good understanding that avoids problems. I wanted to share this with you, as you will receive good news on Friday from the person you like. Additionally, tomorrow will be the best day of your life! 

Please don't break this chain, as it may result in negative consequences. To keep the positive energy going, send this message to your friends within a few minutes of reading it.

Best wishes,
Alice
