Subject: Celebrating 2.5 Years of Friendship

Dear Bob,

I can't believe it has already been two and a half years since we became friends! Time definitely flies, but I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate our friendship and all the memories we've created along the way. Here's to many more years to come! ðŸ˜Š

Best regards,
Alice
