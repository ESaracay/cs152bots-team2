Subject: Long Time No See, Let's Catch Up! 

Hey Alice,

How are you? I hope you're doing well. It's been a while since we last talked. Just wanted to let you know that Del and I are back in town! We missed you and it has been a long time since we last saw each other.

Don't hesitate to give me a call sometime soon. Looking forward to catching up with you!

Take care,
Lucy xx
