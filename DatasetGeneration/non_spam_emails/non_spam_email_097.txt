Subject: Missing Information and Thoughts

Dear Bob,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently received an SMS message from Alice, and it appears that some information is missing from the message. Nonetheless, I wanted to relay the message to you as best as I could.

Here's the message Alice sent:

"Some text missing. Name missing. Number missing. Sent on a date that's missing. Missing you a lot, that's why everything is missing. Sent via fullonsms.com."

Even with the missing details, it's clear that Alice misses you and is thinking of you. Please feel free to respond to Alice at your convenience.

Best regards,
