Subject: Confiding My Feelings

Message:

Dear Bob,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share something with you that has been bothering me lately. The reason I have been so short with you and on-edge as of late is because I never really wanted to tell you any of this. I hope you can understand my hesitation to discuss the matter, and I hope we can work through it together.

Best regards,
Alice
