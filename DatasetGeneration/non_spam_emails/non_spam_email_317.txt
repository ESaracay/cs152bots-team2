Subject: Struggles with Freedom vs. Responsibility

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that have been bothering me lately. Since he moved, we keep butting heads over freedom vs. responsibility, and I'm not sure how to resolve this. I feel like we keep going in circles and it's really starting to wear me out.

On top of that, I have a lot of other things on my plate that I'm struggling to manage. Honestly, I feel like I'm barely keeping myself together with all the added stress and frustration. I just wanted to bring this to your attention, as I think it's important for us to have open communication about these matters.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions on how we can navigate this situation better. I would really appreciate any insights you might have.

Take care and talk to you soon.

Best regards,
Alice
