Subject: Confusion About Friendship and Invitation

Dear Bob,

Alice recently experienced some confusion regarding your friendship. She might have mistakenly invited someone to an event, but she is unsure if that person will come due to financial constraints.

Alice would greatly appreciate any clarification or advice you have on the matter.

Best regards,
Alice
