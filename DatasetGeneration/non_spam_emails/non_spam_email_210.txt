Subject: Missing You and Request for Contacts

Dear Bob,

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I just wanted to let you know that you are truly missed and thought of. I wish you a wonderful day filled with positivity and joy.

By the way, could you please send me Bimbo and Ugo's phone numbers when you have a chance? I would greatly appreciate it. 

Take care and stay safe.

Warm regards,
Alice
