Subject: Seeking an Apology and Reconciliation

Dear Bob,

I wanted to bring up a topic that's been weighing on my mind. I've been feeling frustrated and hurt that you haven't apologized or admitted your mistake, and it's been difficult for me to move forward. I would really appreciate it if you could find it in your heart to acknowledge your wrongdoing and ask me to take you back.

Sincerely,
Alice
