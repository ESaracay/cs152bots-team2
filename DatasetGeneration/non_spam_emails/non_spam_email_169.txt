Subject: Missed Call and Parking Garage Incident

Hey Bob,

I just wanted to let you know that I was in the shower when you called, so sorry I missed it. By the way, I heard that a parking garage collapsed at the university hospital. Now you can see that I'm not crazy when I say stuff like that actually happens.

Take care,

Alice
