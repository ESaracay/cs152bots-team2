Subject: Blood Oath Demand Acknowledgement

Dear Bob,

I hope this email finds you well. Alice wanted to communicate with you about a certain issue at hand. She would like to receive an acknowledgement from you that it's astoundingly tactless and generally inappropriate to demand a blood oath for the situation in question.

Looking forward to hearing your response on this matter.

Best regards,
Alice
