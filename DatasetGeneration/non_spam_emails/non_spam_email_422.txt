Subject: Feeling Neglected and Food Suggestions 

Hi Bob,

I feel horrible because it seems like you're so busy eating at McDonald's that you've forgotten about me. You're taking so long to reply, and I think this situation is worse than before, so be prepared to make it up. Anyway, what do you think I should eat now?

Best,
Alice
