Subject: Listening to a Weird Track at Imperial Music

Hi Bob,

I'm currently at Imperial Music and just had to share this with you - I'm listening to the weirdest track ever by Leafcutter John! Imagine what it would sound like if insects were being molested and someone was plumbing, all while being remixed by evil men on acid. That's exactly what this song sounds like!

Stay tuned for more exciting updates from my musical adventures.

Best regards,
Alice
