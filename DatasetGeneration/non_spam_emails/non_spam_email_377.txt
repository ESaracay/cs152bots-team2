Subject: Missed Train and Parking

Hi Bob,

Just wanted to let you know that I missed my train because of an asthma attack. I have to wait for the next one in half an hour, so I decided to drive in instead. However, I am not sure where to park. Will update you as soon as I figure it out.

Best,
Alice
