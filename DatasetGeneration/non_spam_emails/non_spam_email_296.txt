Subject: The Embarrassing Birthday Surprise

Hey Bob,

I just had to share this funny and embarrassing story of a man that happened last week. So, it was his birthday, and he felt completely forgotten. His wife, parents, kids, and even colleagues didn't wish him at all. Just as he thought no one remembered, his personal assistant greeted him with a warm birthday wish.

Feeling appreciated, he went to lunch with her, and afterward, she invited him to her apartment. Flirting a little, she asked to go into her bedroom for a minute, and he agreed. But, five minutes later, she emerged with a birthday cake, and there they were - his wife, parents, kids, friends, and colleagues all in the room, yelling "SURPRISE!" 

The plot twist? He was sitting on the sofa, completely naked, waiting for something else entirely. Talk about an awkward moment!

Hope this story brings a little laughter to your day.

Best,
Alice
