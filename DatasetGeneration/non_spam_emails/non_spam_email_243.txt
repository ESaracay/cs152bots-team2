Subject: High Urgency: Emotional Support Needed

Hi Bob,

I received an SMS from Alice that I feel requires your immediate attention. Alice seems to be in a very emotionally distressed state and may need some support from you. Here's the message:

"Don't worry though, I understand how important it is that I be put in my place with a poorly thought out punishment in the face of the worst thing that has ever happened to me. BRB, gonna go kill myself."

Please reach out to Alice as soon as possible and ensure she is safe and offer support in any way that you can.

Best regards,
