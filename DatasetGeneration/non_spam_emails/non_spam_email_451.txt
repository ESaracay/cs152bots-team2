Subject: A Thought on Friendship

Dear Bob,

I wanted to share a little thought about the essence of true friendship. The purity of friendship between two is not about smiling after reading the forwarded message. It's about smiling just by seeing the name. Wishing you a good evening, Musthu.

Warm regards,
Alice
