Subject: Regarding Finances and Trust in Derek & Taylor

Message:
Hi Bob,

I just wanted to share my thoughts about our current financial planning. You might want to consider pulling out some extra money as a safety measure. Plan on not spending it if you can, but it's always good to have a cushion. Honestly, I don't have much confidence in Derek and Taylor's money management skills, so it's better to be cautious.

Best regards,
Alice
