Subject: Hesitation About Visiting Friends for Smoking Sessions

Message:

Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to share my thoughts with you. Recently, there's been a pattern emerging with my friends. They keep inviting me to drive up and have smoke sessions with them. The thing is, afterward, they jokingly tell me that I'm a weed fiend, make them smoke too much, or even impede their ability to do other things. 

Because of these remarks, I'm feeling a bit hesitant about joining them in the future. I wanted to get this off my chest and see if you have any thoughts on this situation.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Alice
