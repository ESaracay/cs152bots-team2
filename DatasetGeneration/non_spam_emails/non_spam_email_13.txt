Subject: The Real Meaning of "Hello"

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share this interesting message I got about the origin of the word "hello" when we answer the phone. According to this message, when you lift the phone and say "hello", you're actually using the name of a girl. That girl is Margaret Hello, the girlfriend of Graham Bell who invented the telephone. 

Moral of the story: One can forget the name of a person, but not their inventions.

Have a great day!

Best regards,
Alice
