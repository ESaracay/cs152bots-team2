Subject: Unexpected Surprise Party

Hey Bob,

I had a hilarious experience I wanted to share with you. My parents, my kids, my friends, and my colleagues all planned a surprise party for me. They were all screaming "SURPRISE!" when I walked in the room, but little did they know I was waiting on the sofa... completely naked!

Talk soon,
Alice
