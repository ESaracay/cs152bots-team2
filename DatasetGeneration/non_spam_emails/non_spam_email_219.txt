Subject: IP Address for Minecraft Server

Hi Bob,

I was wondering how my IP address would be able to test a connection if my computer isn't set up as a Minecraft server. Can you please explain the process to me or let me know if there is a different method for testing connections without having a Minecraft server?

Thanks,
Alice
