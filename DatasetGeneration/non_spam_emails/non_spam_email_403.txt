Subject: Encouragement Needed

Hi Bob,

Just wanted to send some encouragement your way. Whenever you may be feeling unsure or uncertain, always remember that you've got this and that we're right here cheering you on! Remember, in some situations, the best response might be "YOU GO GURL!" Embrace that spirit and keep pushing forward.

Best regards,
Alice
