Subject: Upcoming Exams and Car Testing Plans

Hi Bob,

I know you have a lot on your plate, so I'll keep this brief. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be focusing on my exams for the time being. Once they're done, I'll be able to test out the cars we discussed earlier. I hope you have a great day!

Best regards,
Alice
