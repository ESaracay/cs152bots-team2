Subject: Apology for Hair Incident

Hi Bob,

I just wanted to reach out and sincerely apologize for accidentally lighting your hair on fire. It was a careless mistake and I completely understand if you're upset about it. I hope any damage caused can be easily fixed and that we can move past this unfortunate incident.

Again, I'm deeply sorry and I hope you're okay.

Best regards,
