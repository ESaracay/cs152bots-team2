Subject: SMS Conversion: Missed Call Game Rules

Dear Bob,

Alice wanted me to let you know about a game she's been enjoying. She wrote:
"Miss call miss call khelate kintu opponenter miss call dhorte lage. That's the rule. One with great phone receiving quality wins."

The game involves giving each other missed calls and trying to catch the opponent's missed call. The one who can successfully receive the most phone calls wins. It seems like a fun way to test your phone's capabilities!

Best regards,
