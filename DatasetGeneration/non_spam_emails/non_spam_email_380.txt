Subject: Job Prospects and Updates

Hi Bob,

Good afternoon, my love! Just wanted to check in with you about any job prospects. Also, I'm curious if you're missing me? What have you been up to these days? Are you being lazy and bleak, hmmm? Or are you happy and filled with my love? Can't wait to hear from you.

Warm Regards,
Alice
