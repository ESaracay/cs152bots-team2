Subject: God's Endless Blessings and Good Night Wishes

Dear Bob,

I'm writing to remind you that God's love has no limit, His grace has no measure, and His power has no boundaries. May you always experience His endless blessings in your life, and never forget His presence. Wishing you a peaceful and restful night.

Good night, take care!

Warm regards,
Alice
