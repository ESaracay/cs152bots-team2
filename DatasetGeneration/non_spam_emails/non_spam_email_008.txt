Subject: Possible Health Concern Update Request

Hi Bob,

Alice just sent a message regarding your current health situation. She suggests that you monitor your condition over the next 6 hours to see if anything changes. While appendix issues are generally more common in younger individuals, she wants you to keep in mind that it's not an impossibility. To help alleviate any stress, she advises that you take it easy and just let her know how you're feeling in about 6 hours.

Take care and update her later.

Best,
