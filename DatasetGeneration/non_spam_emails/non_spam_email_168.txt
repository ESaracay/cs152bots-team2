Subject: Thoughts on Minecraft Building Strategies

Hey Bob,

Just wanted to share my thoughts on Minecraft building strategies. I consider walls and bunkers important as I never play on peaceful mode. However, it seems like your base is high enough that it shouldn't really matter. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best regards,
Alice
