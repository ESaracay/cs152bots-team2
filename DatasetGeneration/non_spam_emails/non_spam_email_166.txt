Subject: Unfelt Birthday Wishes

Dear Bob,

I wanted to share with you a sad story that happened to a man last week. It was his birthday, but surprisingly, his wife didn't wish him a happy birthday. Not only that, but his parents and kids also forgot about it completely. 

When he went to work, he might have hoped that at least his colleagues would remember and make his day special. But even they did not wish him a happy birthday.

Sincerely,
Alice
