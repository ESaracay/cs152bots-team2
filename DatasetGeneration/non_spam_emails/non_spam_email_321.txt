Subject: Flat Viewing Update

Hi Bob,

I just wanted to give you an update on the flat viewings. I met with a potential flatmate earlier who seemed alright. He's in his 50s and mentioned that he's frequently away because of his job. We also have a woman scheduled to come for a viewing at 6:30 PM. I'll keep you posted on how everything goes.

Best,
Alice
