Subject: Thoughts on Finance Career After Degree Completion

Dear Bob,

I just wanted to share a thought I had about the future - after completing our degrees, I feel there might not be much value in joining finance. What do you think? It's just a thought but I wanted to discuss this further with you.

Looking forward to hearing your opinion.

Best,
Alice
