Subject: Free Ringtone Offer

Dear Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. I just came across this cool offer where you can get a free ringtone for your phone! To claim it, simply reply with "REAL" or "POLY" followed by the corresponding number of the ringtone you like. For example, if you want the "PushButton" ringtone, just reply with "REAL1". Here are the available ringtones:

1. PushButton
2. DontCha
3. BabyGoodbye
4. GoldDigger
5. WeBeBurnin

When you claim your first free ringtone, you will also get 6 more when you join for Â£3 per week. Don't miss this fun opportunity!

Best regards,
Alice
