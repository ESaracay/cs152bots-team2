Subject: Urgent: Prize Claiming Information

Dear Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to inform you about a potential prize opportunity that I received via SMS. The message contains details about a prize you could win, but it requires immediate action on your part. Here are the details:

"If you don't, your prize will go to another customer. T&C at www.t-c.biz 18+ 150p/min Polo Ltd Suite 373 London W1J 6HL Please call back if busy."

Although it may seem enticing, please use caution and verify the authenticity of this message before taking any steps. Stay safe!

Best regards,
Alice
