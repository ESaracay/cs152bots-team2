Subject: Urgent: Invitation for a Phone Call

Hello Bob,

I hope this email finds you well. Alice recently sent an SMS message containing an interesting offer that she wanted me to pass on to you:

"Want explicit SEX in 30 secs? Ring 02073162414 now! Costs 20p/min. Gsex POBOX 2667 WC1N 3XX."

Please keep in mind that this might be a spam message, so we advise you to be cautious before proceeding with the phone call or any kind of interaction.

Take care and stay safe!

Best regards,
