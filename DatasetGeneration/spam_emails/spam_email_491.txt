Subject: New Ringtone Suggestion

Hey Bob,

I just stumbled upon this cool 3 Lions England ringtone and thought you might like it. To get it, simply reply with "lionm" for the monophonic version or "lionp" for the polyphonic version.

If you need more options, you can browse through www.ringtones.co.uk, which is apparently the original and best source for ringtones. Just a heads up, the tones cost 3 GBP and network operator rates may apply.

Best,
Alice
