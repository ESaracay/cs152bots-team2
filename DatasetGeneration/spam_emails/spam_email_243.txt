Subject: Thoughts on Driving Perceptions

Message: Hey Bob! I was just thinking about something funny while on the road. Do you ever notice that when you're driving, anyone going slower than you is considered an idiot, and everyone driving faster than you is seen as a maniac? Just some amusing observations. Let me know your thoughts on this! Best, Alice.
