Subject: Weekly Draw for £250 Gift Voucher

Dear Bob,

I just wanted to share this quick message I found about a weekly draw for a £250 gift voucher. All you have to do is text "Knock Knock" and "Whose there" to 80082 for a chance to win. The voucher can be used at a store of your choice! For more details about terms and conditions, you can visit www.tkls.com. Keep in mind, you need to be at least 16 years old to participate. To stop receiving these texts, just reply with "stoptxtstop." Just know, it costs £1.50 per text message.

Best,
Alice
