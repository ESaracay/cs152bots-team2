Subject: Unexpected Phone Bill and Upcoming Bailiff Visit

Dear Bob,

I recently inquired with 3Mobile customer service about whether 0870 chat lines were included in my free minutes. The representative from their India-based customer service center confirmed that they were. However, I have since received a massive bill. 

Even though I only owe £250, 3Mobile is demanding £800. Now, a bailiff is expected to visit me in a matter of days. I feel that the company hasn't been helpful or understanding about this situation.

Sincerely,
Alice
