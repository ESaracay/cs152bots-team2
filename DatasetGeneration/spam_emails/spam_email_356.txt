Subject: Moby Pub Quiz - Win a High Street Prize!

Message:

Hey Bob,

I just got this SMS and wanted to share it with you. There's a chance to win a £100 High Street prize if you know who the new Duchess of Cornwall will be. If you know her first name, text it to 82277. Make sure to unsub by texting "STOP" if you don't want to receive these messages, but keep in mind it costs £1.50.

Good luck!

Alice
