Subject: Harry Potter Trivia Contest

Hi Bob,

I have some exciting news! There is a competition going on where you can win the latest "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)". To participate, all you need to do is reply with the word "HARRY" and answer five questions. This is a great opportunity to be among the first to read this highly anticipated book. 

Good luck, and let me know if you decide to participate!

Best,
Alice
