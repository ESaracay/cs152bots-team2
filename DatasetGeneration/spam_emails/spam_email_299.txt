Subject: SMS to Email Conversion: Guaranteed Cash Award Notification

Message: 
Hi Bob,

Just received this SMS message and thought I'd pass it along. Here's the message: "You have won a guaranteed £32,000 award or maybe even £1,000 cash. To claim your award, call free on 0800 [number redacted]. (18+). It's a legitimate free phone number. What do you think???"
