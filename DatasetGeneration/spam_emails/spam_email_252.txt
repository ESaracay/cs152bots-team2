Subject: Potential for abuse withthesmszone.com

Hi Bob,

I came across a website called thesmszone.com that allows you to send free anonymous and masked messages. I just sent you a message from there, and I'm concerned about the potential for abuse with this service. Let's discuss further.

Best,
Alice
