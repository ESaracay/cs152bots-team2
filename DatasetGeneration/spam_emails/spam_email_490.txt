Subject: Scammers Alert

Hi Bob,

It's Alice. Just wanted to let you know that scammers are getting smarter these days. It seems they are using regular Vodafone numbers to send premium rate messages or subscriptions when you respond to them. Be careful and make sure to not respond to unknown numbers. Stay safe!

Best,
Alice
