Subject: Intriguing Proposition

Dear Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I find you very attractive, and I'm feeling rather adventurous at the moment. I admit, I do have a preference for men with a little edge to them. Would you be interested in spending some intimate time together, maybe taking things slow and intense? I'm really looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Alice
