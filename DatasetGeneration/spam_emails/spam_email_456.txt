Subject: A Mysterious Dating Service Inquiry

Hi Bob,

I received an intriguing SMS message that I thought might interest you. It reads:

"Someone you know has asked our dating service to contact you! Can't guess who? CALL 09058091854 NOW, and all will be revealed. PO BOX 385, M6 6WU."

It seems like you have an admirer who went through a dating service to get in touch. If you're curious, you should give the provided number a call.

Best,
Alice
